# senescence-quantifier
A macro-based quantification method for cellular senescence based on SA-β-Galactosidase staining

Please find a description of how to use the macro in the provided manual.
Macros were developed and tested using ImageJ (v1.52d) by Damir Krunic and Joscha Kraske.

In this repository you find 2 versions of the macro. 
The first one 'Single' is for the analysis of individual samples to test and optimize settings.
The secound one 'Batch' is for the high-througput anlaysis of many samples. For this SA-β-Gal images and DAPI images have to be stored in 2 seprate folders.
